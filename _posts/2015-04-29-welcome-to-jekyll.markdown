My first post! I'm testing out Jekyll to make a blog. Also, to help me use the command line more. I will be posting anything and everything that I feel entice to share. Whether it is syntax that I need to reference, or the "Ah-ha" moments I have learning different languages. 

Everyday I traverse to new lessons and continue to build on my coding knowledge. Hope to enlighten, not just myself, but all readers soon and frequent.
